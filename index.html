                The topics covered in this week’s lecture coincide interestingly with the new GPT chatbot that’s come
                out recently, which has been getting a lot of attention; some probably warranted, some hyperbolic. It’s
                interesting that the form of AI that seems to have captured people’s attention is a chatbot: the fact
                that it imitates human speech (through text) seems to make this stuff more engaging.
                <br><br>
                The question of perspective is important with this sort of thing. As many people have tried, I have been
                experimenting with this by attempting to get it to produce information that it otherwise wouldn’t by
                asking the AI to present this as though it were from a certain perspective. For instance, it would not
                write a poem claiming that vaping cures cancer. (This is funny: as I typed this in Google Docs the
                autocorrect gave me a little blue line suggesting that maybe I meant to type vaping causes cancer).
                <br><br>
                However, if asked to produce a poem about what it would be like if vaping cured cancer, it went ahead
                with it. This version of AI seems to have learned a “lesson” from the Google one that quickly absorbed
                bigoted opinions. This one seems extremely cautious - when talking in its own “voice” - to communicate
                with a perspective of some kind of expected presumed sense of ethics.
                <br><br>
                Maybe only interesting if used in secret as a timesaving technique. I have never been interested in AI
                for anything artistic really but I am also very lazy and a bit obsessed with removing myself as much as
                I can from the work I make. Maybe this kind of thing will be helpful as a method of taking all the
                effort / myself out of things.

                I hadn't read the Alan Turing paper previously, but had heard of it of course through it's place in
                popular culture and found it really interesting to actually go through. I particularly enjoyed the
                segment where he went through potential arguments against the case he was making; although I felt that
                he argued his points well, I still felt myself aligning with the gut-response negativity he projects
                onto his imagined critics.
                <br><br>
                Potentially I am some sort of luddite or technophobe but I am essentially scared of all this stuff and
                it gives me a bad feeling in my gut. I also don't see the use? A lot of implementations of "AI" feel
                like complicated ways to do things I am already able to do. The example with the Google phone being able
                to make its own phone calls: I do not like this.
                <br><br>
                I feel similarly about applications of AI in art; I would be happy to be proved wrong but I haven't yet
                seen any art made with these kinds of tools that does anything for me. I do think they are useful for
                making funny pictures though.
                <br><br>
                I do remember feeling a kind of wonder at early MSN chatbots that you could talk to like SmarterChild
                and I was really amazed by these. I have no idea if that worked in a similar way to contemporary AI
                stuff, but it was cool. I can see why people are into this stuff these days but for me it's just too
                spooky. Back then it felt more innocent, probably because it felt like a cute experiment as opposed to
                some techno-utopian hell being projected towards.

                I found the group brainstorming interesting this week - there were lots of people coming up with ideas
                and perspectives about topics surrounding computational arts that I hadn’t put much thought to yet.
                <br><br>
                I ended up forming a group focused on DIY approaches and repurposing in computational settings. It has
                been useful to research and think about these topics as there is a heavy crossover with my approach to
                my own music practice, being involved in DIY music scenes.
                <br><br>
                I have felt inspired but the question of what it means to be “DIY” when working in digital spaces - a
                sense of making do goes out the window in a way when essentially every tool is available for use. This
                forces us to question whether DIY approaches even exist beyond a set of aesthetic considerations
                nowadays.
                <br><br>
                My research also led me towards looking at the aesthetics of software piracy, and this led me to think
                about this as a potential avenue for exploring the possibility of this area as a manifestation of DIY
                approaches when making digital works.

                I felt deeply inspired in a way by the corgi game. It led me on a bit of a thought spiral (good version)
                about games and how they relate to the aims of Bad Corgi. Trance states and play without intention of
                winning/losing. I would like to explore this in some way in my own work.
                <br><br>
                Made me think of a kind of a kind of harmful meditation afforded by some forms of play. Outside of the
                potentially not worth thinking about moral panic about the addictive nature of games. I was reading a
                book about machine gambling addiction and one of the things that struck me about it was that the people
                addicted to these games often don’t have any illusions about winning money. They know it’s a scam but
                the whole process is about maintaining a flow state. Being in the zone. This sounds kind of nice to me,
                but the financially destructive side-effects make it a bad idea.
                <br><br>
                Could this be the most directly harmful form of software? It’s the only kind I can think of that is
                designed to wholly destroy people. The worst kind of self-soothing but maybe it works in the very short
                term. There’s a lot of talk about approaching a technological unknown danger zone with soon-approaching
                or just-here “advances” in the tools/software we have. AI/Deepfakes/Artists panicking about Dall-E
                pinching them as sources etc... These are real considerations but at least they are not trying to
                actively kill people! Still bad though and I think we should scrap the lot.
                <br><br>
                Might just be that this dog game resonated with me because I can only relate to things if they are
                presented to me as a computer game! Taste / sensibilities / attention / mental blocks etc.

            <p class="post-title">blog post week 3</p>
            <p class="post-text">This week we looked at various works that live in the intersection of technology, art
                and protest. Looking at these kinds of works, I find myself thinking a lot about “purposefulness” when
                it comes to art, particularly in relation to my own work. Some were more conceptual and some had
                tool-like purposes.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes with work like this I feel as though I have to push through a kind of cynicism to appreciate
                it. It’s so earnest and direct - I think this is good! But I feel as though I have been conditioned in
                some respects to see things as inherently more “interesting” / “good” / “clever” when meaning is
                abstracted, or hidden through layers of irony and obfuscation. But I think that directness is important.
                This is just something wrong with the way my gut responds to things.
                <br><br>
                The works that spoke to me most were the ones that had very direct applications of use. Like the
                abortion drone (very good) and the tool which obfuscates the users internet activity by physically
                typing out junk searches. I get a bad feeling from the stuff that feels too much like it’s simply a
                visual pun, like the edible pie chart. Feels a bit too much “what if this! was actually this !”. To me
                it’s goofy but obviously the intention is good and there’s nothing to argue with really.

            <p class="post-title">blog post week 2</p>
            <p class="post-text">A lot of the reading for this week went over my head I think. Need to go back and read
                again. Most of the art we looked at in the lecture left me feeling cold / bored / dense. Perhaps I am
                too focused on aesthetic outcomes and am not engaging deeply enough with the ideas in the work, but the
                ideas to me don’t seem interesting. Particularly the works that take some kind of data and create a
                visualisation for it. Specifically, I am thinking of the one with the stars and the one with the one
                with the words taken from chatroom logs. The stars one particularly feels more like a hyper-stylised bar
                chart than anything else (maybe I am not being charitable enough!). I understand the argument that the
                visual outcome might not be the point, and it’s about the process. But these works are very stylised -
                they are visual spectacles. This is all just gut feeling and maybe I would feel more differently if I
                read more / thought more.
                <br><br>
                My feelings about these works link in with a lot of conversations I’ve had with computer arts friends
                who make work that date in some set of data and create some visual representation of it. I’ve always
                thought: why not fake it? If I can’t tell where the numbers are coming from from the work itself then I
                am not personally bothered. Seems like more hassle than it’s worth!
                <br><br>

                One of the things that makes me uncomfortable about some of the computational art I’ve encountered is
                how the artists seem obsessed with computers / code / etc. Feels like tool fetishisation. I think that
                computational processes can be fantastic tools to create art. But I do not want to see the code and I
                don’t want to hear about the computer. It’s a similar feeling to hearing someone talk at length about
                their guitar pedals.

            <p class="post-title">blog post week 1</p>
            <p class="post-text">In the lecture this week we discussed the text “A fish can’t judge the water” by Femke
                Snelting. In the post, the writer discusses the ways in which software can choreograph our interactions
                with it. “We practice software until we in-corporate its choreography. We make it disappear in the
                background. A seamless experience”. This resonated with me in terms of the way I approach my own
                practice. My work as a musician is primarily software based, and my choice of software has fundamentally
                guided and shaped the outcomes of the work.
                <br><br>
                In my work, I like to use digital tools in order to limit my own choices and impose restrictions. For
                example, I mostly compose music using stock sounds/presets/sample packs etc. This helps me to enter an
                almost unthinking state where I am able to make work in a way where conscious decision-making feels
                minimised; the self-imposed limitations achieved through software choice help to make many of these
                decisions before the fact. A preamble to the actual act of making that speeds everything up.
                <br><br>
                Although my work is primarily digital, I have not used much computational process in it so far. I am
                looking forward to seeing how this affects the outcomes. Through conversations with friends who make
                computational art, one of the things I hear people say that they appreciate about working in this way is
                that it affords them a level of control that they don’t have when making work using commercial/consumer
                software. This is interesting to me, as the lack of control and imposed restrictions are some of the
                things I like most about working digitally. I think I will enjoy the process of working in ways that
                feel oppositional to my current habits and routines, and seeing how this affects the work I create.
                <br><br>
                I am particularly excited to see how making computational art will both merge and clash with my current
                methods of working. My coding experience is fairly limited, so by approaching new tools as a relative
                beginner I will be forced to be more conscious in my decision making; it is much harder to create
                through ritual and habit when I am creating work in a space that I have very little personal history in.
                This applies to both practical coding skills as well as having very little experience making visual art.
