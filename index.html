            <p class="post-title">blog post week 2</p>
            <p class="post-text">This week we looked at various works that live in the intersection of technology, art
                and protest. Looking at these kinds of works, I find myself thinking a lot about “purposefulness” when
                it comes to art, particularly in relation to my own work. Some were more conceptual and some had
                tool-like purposes.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes with work like this I feel as though I have to push through a kind of cynicism to appreciate
                it. It’s so earnest and direct - I think this is good! But I feel as though I have been conditioned in
                some respects to see things as inherently more “interesting” / “good” / “clever” when meaning is
                abstracted, or hidden through layers of irony and obfuscation. But I think that directness is important.
                This is just something wrong with the way my gut responds to things.
                <br><br>
                The works that spoke to me most were the ones that had very direct applications of use. Like the
                abortion drone (very good) and the tool which obfuscates the users internet activity by physically
                typing out junk searches. I get a bad feeling from the stuff that feels too much like it’s simply a
                visual pun, like the edible pie chart. Feels a bit too much “what if this! was actually this !”. To me
                it’s goofy but obviously the intention is good and there’s nothing to argue with really.

            <p class="post-title">blog post week 2</p>
            <p class="post-text">A lot of the reading for this week went over my head I think. Need to go back and read
                again. Most of the art we looked at in the lecture left me feeling cold / bored / dense. Perhaps I am
                too focused on aesthetic outcomes and am not engaging deeply enough with the ideas in the work, but the
                ideas to me don’t seem interesting. Particularly the works that take some kind of data and create a
                visualisation for it. Specifically, I am thinking of the one with the stars and the one with the one
                with the words taken from chatroom logs. The stars one particularly feels more like a hyper-stylised bar
                chart than anything else (maybe I am not being charitable enough!). I understand the argument that the
                visual outcome might not be the point, and it’s about the process. But these works are very stylised -
                they are visual spectacles. This is all just gut feeling and maybe I would feel more differently if I
                read more / thought more.
                <br><br>
                My feelings about these works link in with a lot of conversations I’ve had with computer arts friends
                who make work that date in some set of data and create some visual representation of it. I’ve always
                thought: why not fake it? If I can’t tell where the numbers are coming from from the work itself then I
                am not personally bothered. Seems like more hassle than it’s worth!
                <br><br>

                One of the things that makes me uncomfortable about some of the computational art I’ve encountered is
                how the artists seem obsessed with computers / code / etc. Feels like tool fetishisation. I think that
                computational processes can be fantastic tools to create art. But I do not want to see the code and I
                don’t want to hear about the computer. It’s a similar feeling to hearing someone talk at length about
                their guitar pedals.

            <p class="post-title">blog post week 1</p>
            <p class="post-text">In the lecture this week we discussed the text “A fish can’t judge the water” by Femke
                Snelting. In the post, the writer discusses the ways in which software can choreograph our interactions
                with it. “We practice software until we in-corporate its choreography. We make it disappear in the
                background. A seamless experience”. This resonated with me in terms of the way I approach my own
                practice. My work as a musician is primarily software based, and my choice of software has fundamentally
                guided and shaped the outcomes of the work.
                <br><br>
                In my work, I like to use digital tools in order to limit my own choices and impose restrictions. For
                example, I mostly compose music using stock sounds/presets/sample packs etc. This helps me to enter an
                almost unthinking state where I am able to make work in a way where conscious decision-making feels
                minimised; the self-imposed limitations achieved through software choice help to make many of these
                decisions before the fact. A preamble to the actual act of making that speeds everything up.
                <br><br>
                Although my work is primarily digital, I have not used much computational process in it so far. I am
                looking forward to seeing how this affects the outcomes. Through conversations with friends who make
                computational art, one of the things I hear people say that they appreciate about working in this way is
                that it affords them a level of control that they don’t have when making work using commercial/consumer
                software. This is interesting to me, as the lack of control and imposed restrictions are some of the
                things I like most about working digitally. I think I will enjoy the process of working in ways that
                feel oppositional to my current habits and routines, and seeing how this affects the work I create.
                <br><br>
                I am particularly excited to see how making computational art will both merge and clash with my current
                methods of working. My coding experience is fairly limited, so by approaching new tools as a relative
                beginner I will be forced to be more conscious in my decision making; it is much harder to create
                through ritual and habit when I am creating work in a space that I have very little personal history in.
                This applies to both practical coding skills as well as having very little experience making visual art.
