            <p class="post-title">blog post week 1</p>
            <p class="post-text">In the lecture this week we discussed the text “A fish can’t judge the water” by Femke
                Snelting. In the post, the writer discusses the ways in which software can choreograph our interactions
                with it. “We practice software until we in-corporate its choreography. We make it disappear in the
                background. A seamless experience”. This resonated with me in terms of the way I approach my own
                practice. My work as a musician is primarily software based, and my choice of software has fundamentally
                guided and shaped the outcomes of the work.
                <br><br>
                In my work, I like to use digital tools in order to limit my own choices and impose restrictions. For
                example, I mostly compose music using stock sounds/presets/sample packs etc. This helps me to enter an
                almost unthinking state where I am able to make work in a way where conscious decision-making feels
                minimised; the self-imposed limitations achieved through software choice help to make many of these
                decisions before the fact. A preamble to the actual act of making that speeds everything up.
                <br><br>
                Although my work is primarily digital, I have not used much computational process in it so far. I am
                looking forward to seeing how this affects the outcomes. Through conversations with friends who make
                computational art, one of the things I hear people say that they appreciate about working in this way is
                that it affords them a level of control that they don’t have when making work using commercial/consumer
                software. This is interesting to me, as the lack of control and imposed restrictions are some of the
                things I like most about working digitally. I think I will enjoy the process of working in ways that
                feel oppositional to my current habits and routines, and seeing how this affects the work I create.
                <br><br>
                I am particularly excited to see how making computational art will both merge and clash with my current
                methods of working. My coding experience is fairly limited, so by approaching new tools as a relative
                beginner I will be forced to be more conscious in my decision making; it is much harder to create
                through ritual and habit when I am creating work in a space that I have very little personal history in.
                This applies to both practical coding skills as well as having very little experience making visual art.
